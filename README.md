This Github repository contains the data, the analysis script, and the figures in the paper.

## A description of the repository content
Note: as mentioned in the paper, we call the element in a personal that goes first *prefix-name* and the element that goes second *byname*. For example, in the name *John Smith*, *John* is the prefix-name and *Smith* is the byname. In the name *Li Xiaoping*, *Li* is the prefix-name and *Xiaoping* is the byname.
